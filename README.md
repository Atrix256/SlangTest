# SlangTest

Slang is essentially a superset of HLSL which adds some very nice features.

It can output plain hlsl which flattens all those nice features into standard shader code.
It can also output other types of shader languages, as well as compiled shader binaries.

This demo shows how to load a slang file, spit out plain hlsl, and reflection information.
